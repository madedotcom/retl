gsLoadSheet(key, tab)
}
\arguments{
\item{key}{Something that identifies a Google Sheet: its file ID, a URL from which we can recover the ID, an instance of googlesheets4_spreadsheet (returned by gs4_get()), or a dribble, which is how googledrive represents Drive files. Processed through as_sheets_id().}

\item{tab}{Sheet to read, in the sense of "worksheet" or "tab". You can identify a sheet by name, with a string, or by position, with a number. Ignored if the sheet is specified via range. If neither argument specifies the sheet, defaults to the first visible sheet.}
